Password Evaluation Report
==========================

1. Password: 8u*QjV$z@XZ#
   - Score: 100%
   - Feedback: Very strong password. Includes uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters, and has good length (12+). No predictable patterns.

2. Password: admin
   - Score: 7%
   - Feedback: Extremely weak. Common word, all lowercase, very short. Easily guessable and vulnerable to dictionary attacks.

3. Password: password123
   - Score: 43%
   - Feedback: Weak. Based on a common word followed by numbers. Lacks symbols and case variety. Easily guessable.

4. Password: Abcdefg!
   - Score: 39%
   - Feedback: Weak. Sequential characters, contains only one special character. No numbers. Short length.

5. Password: Th1sIs$Str0ng
   - Score: 100%
   - Feedback: Very strong. Good mix of characters, uses substitutions (1 for I, $ for S), and passphrase-style makes it memorable and secure.


Summary: Best Practices for Strong Passwords
============================================

- Use at least 12 characters.
- Combine uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Include numbers and special characters.
- Avoid dictionary words and common substitutions alone.
- Do not use sequential characters (e.g., abc123) or repeated patterns.
- Consider using passphrases (a series of words or sentences).
- Change passwords regularly and donâ€™t reuse them across accounts.
- Use a password manager to store and generate secure passwords.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible.

Tips Learned from the Evaluation
================================

- Complexity and length are crucial for password strength.
- Predictable words or patterns drastically reduce security.
- Passphrase-style passwords strike a good balance between memorability and strength.
- Password strength checkers provide helpful feedback on what weakens a password.

Common Password Attacks
=======================

1. Brute Force Attack:
   - The attacker tries every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found.
   - Long and complex passwords increase the time it takes to succeed.

2. Dictionary Attack:
   - Uses a predefined list of common words and passwords to guess the correct one.
   - Passwords like "admin", "password123", or "qwerty" are easy targets.

3. Credential Stuffing:
   - Uses previously leaked username-password pairs to access accounts.
   - Reusing passwords across sites makes users vulnerable.

4. Phishing:
   - Tricks users into revealing their password through fake websites or emails.
   - Always verify URLs and avoid clicking suspicious links.

5. Keylogging:
   - Malicious software records keystrokes to steal passwords.
   - Anti-malware tools and MFA help defend against this.

Stay secure by following password best practices and staying aware of common cyber threats.


How Password Complexity Affects Security
========================================

Password complexity significantly enhances security by making it harder for attackers to guess or crack passwords using automated methods. Here's how it helps:

- **Increased Combinations:** More character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) increase the total number of possible combinations.
- **Resistance to Attacks:** Complex passwords are harder to crack with brute force or dictionary attacks due to unpredictability.
- **Reduced Guessability:** Randomness and the use of uncommon characters make passwords difficult to guess manually or algorithmically.
- **Delays Automated Tools:** Tools designed to crack passwords take significantly longer when faced with complex and long passwords.

In summary, password complexity raises the cost, time, and effort required for unauthorized access, making your accounts far more secure.
